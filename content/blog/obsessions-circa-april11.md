In a brief moment of calm that is the onslaught of April in academia (although I hope this week to finally finish up some of the posts that have been sitting in my drafts folder for months now), a few things I can't stop thinking about:

## Anna Meredith's *Varmints*

<iframe class="embed-no-caption" width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/57099033&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>

This track is from 2012 and I'm only just hearing it now off the Scottish composer Anna Meredith's first full-length *Varmints*. I've been slipping into listening to more and more electronic and synth-driven music over the past few months (be glad I didn't write this post last week when Yaz's ["Only You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIiyT67Sjbg) was inexplicably in rotation for me, probably because of a scene in Thing Obsession #3), and "Nautilus" arrived as a revelation for me. The way the beat comes in about three-quarters of the way through and terraforms your understanding of the interlocking horns; this is a song of swagger and menace and vibrancy, and while the whole album doesn't (how could it?) live up to the opening track's highs, it's still a hell of a high.

## My Raspberry Pi

I love this little thing. I finally bought one after years of dithering about not having a project to run on it, until I found the [RetroPie](http://retropie.org.uk) project and some incredible software history torrents on the Internet Archive. And you know what? It's still a joyously useless piece of hardware. It sits next to my TV, and sometimes I remember to hook it up and play [Hatris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wOFyKq1RY8). When I turn it on, my friends joke that my TV is hacking into the Matrix. It has a cute little pink and white case. I named it Winifred.

(I'm working on a longer post now about the idea of "minimal computing" in DH, and how devices like the Raspberry Pi alongside a rhetorical turn to the "command line" across a number of DH and web development tools operate within contemporary cultural turns to "slowness" in, say, [television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_television) or [food](http://www.slowfoodusa.org). For more intel, the [Mincomp DH Working Group Blog](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) succinctly lays out [though the site's a bit barebones right now] the potential stakes for a turn towards computing done under constraints. More on this, hopefully, soon.)
