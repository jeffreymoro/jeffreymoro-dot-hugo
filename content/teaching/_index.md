## Teaching Interests

As a graduate instructor, I teach a mixture of courses in digital media studies, film studies, and writing composition. My focus in these classes is two-fold: first, to stage encounters with rich archives of media in disciplines my students often don't know exist, let alone that can drive a career; and second, to teach my students how to harness their curiosity, such that they learn how to follow hunches, develop sophisticated arguments, and understand the humanities as a function of their lived experiences. I also run the occasional workshop targeted at my fellow graduate students, on topics such as basic web development, social media, and digital humanities methods.
