## (Revised) Pandemic Contingency Mode

Hi! If you're reading this, we've entered *pandemic contingency mode*. Exciting! I have revised these edits since before spring break, so please familiarize yourself with the changes below. 

Here are the major modifications to the class given our new reality:

- We now have a two-week spring break. We're going to cut *Love and Anarchy* as a result.
- After that break, we will conduct class online for the rest of the term. This will be entirely asynchronous: there are no shared meetings you have to join. Our class's platform of choice will be **Slack**. It's essentially a glorified chat program. Throughout the week, you can drop in and out for conversation at your leisure. That replaces our in-person meetings. 
- Each Monday, I will post a short video or two as a mini-lecture. These videos will give you entry points to major concepts, context on the films, and so forth. I will upload these to a Google Drive folder linked on ELMS and also put the links directly in Slack. 
- I will post discussion-starter questions in Slack. You can dip in and out and respond to them and to each other throughout the week. I'm not keeping a hard track of who responds when and I don't intend for these to be formal discussion posts. Slack conversation can and perhaps *should* be casual. Think plentiful emoji. 
- I will commit to being present on Slack during the times we would have met IRL: T/Th from 2 PM to 3:30 PM. Otherwise, I'll dip in and out. I'll take a glance at least once a day but won't be lurking. 
- This class is **pass/fail** unless you request a grade. Starting immediately I will no longer give grades for assignments. I will still give ample comments, to the extent that I am able. There are no longer late penalties, though I ask that you do your best to turn in assignments at the normal due dates, just to make it easier on all of us. The way UMD does pass/fail is that I still provide a letter grade, which is converted on your transcript to a "pass" if it exceeds a certain threshold. You can safely assume that if you 1) make a good faith effort on the assignments; 2) participate in the Slack to the best of you ability; and 3) stay in touch with me if you need to dip in and out or if things get hard, then that letter grade hiding behind your "pass" will be an A. 
- Finally, we'll use ELMS's assignment submission features more heavily. You can still email me your work, but I'll give you feedback through ELMS. 

Remember: no one will be penalized for not having access to course resources online in the event of a pandemic. If you don't have stable internet, housing, food, and otherwise what you need to be able to succeed in the college classroom, please come talk to me.

### Pandemic Assignments

As this course is now **pass/fail**, as detailed above, the calculus for assignments has changed somewhat. 

The way UMD does pass/fail is that I still provide a letter grade, which is converted on your transcript to a "pass" if it exceeds a certain threshold. You can safely assume that if you 1) make a good faith effort on the assignments; 2) participate in the Slack to the best of you ability; and 3) stay in touch with me if you need to dip in and out or if things get hard, then that letter grade hiding behind your "pass" will be an A. 

UMD has also extended the date to withdraw from classes to May 12th, the last day of class. If I feel that your performance in the class doesn't merit a "pass," I will encourage you well in advance of the deadline to consider withdrawing. If you are a senior who needs this course to graduate, obviously come talk to me and we'll be sure to work something out. 

As for the remaining assignments—

The midterm essay remains the same. Please feel free to write me over the break if you want to brainstorm topics or have me read work in progress. I am also happy to set up individual virtual meetings. 

I will send out more information about the editing assignment or short responses assignment when we return to instruction at the end of March. Essentially you will have the option either to 1) do the editing assignment as originally devised, or 2) write three short (1-1.5 pp.) papers throughout the back half of the semester. These short papers will be posted as regular discussion threads on ELMS. (Yes, they're basically blog posts! My apologies, but it's what we all voted for before the break.)

The final exam will be the same, but scaled back a bit. Think two short essays instead of three. Or perhaps just a short response to the class more generally. We'll think about this together.

*This is the original version of the syllabus, pre-pandemic.*

## Description

This course introduces you to the discipline of film studies: the formal, theoretical, and historical analysis of the moving image. We'll pursue this goal in two parts: first, by developing a critical language with which to discuss film form and its historical progression; and second, by applying this language to questions of film's cultural meaning. Along the way, we'll discuss film's relationship to related questions of media and mediation, in particular the status of film within an increasingly digital world. 

## Aims

It is my hope that by the end of this course you will:

- Develop a facility with the languages of film studies, in particular those associated with its form such as editing, cinematography, mise-en-scene, and narrative. 
- Situate these langauges within broader critiques of film's relationship to culture, history, and politics. 
- Practice the critical and creative techniques of film studies across a range of written and hands-on assignments.
- Connect film studies to broader interdisciplinary questions of media and mediation, particularly across film's historical and material transformation from a technical curiosity to a mass consumer object. 

## Materials

There is one textbook I would like you to obtain for this class: 

- Bordwell, David and Kristin Johnson. *Film Art: An Introduction*.

You will notice there are multiple editions and that some of the more recent ones (it's up to the 12th) are extremely expensive. However, any edition from the 7th on will suffice for this class—and be much cheaper, especially used. (As of this writing, the 8th and 9th editions seem to have many cheap used copies on Amazon.) I will make the textbook's readings for the first few weeks of class available as .pdfs to give you the chance to secure copies. If the textbook presents a financial difficulty for you, please contact me and we can make arrangements. 

You can consider the textbook necessary background to our class discussions. We will spend comparatively little time on it directly, but rather focus on the films themselves as well as the other course readings. All these materials will be available on our course website: the films on streaming; and the readings as .pdfs. 

The films we will watch this semester are: 

- *A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night* (Ana Lily Amirpour, 2014)
- *Sherlock, Jr.* (Buster Keaton, 1924)
- *Strike* (Sergei Eisenstein, 1925)
- *The Shop Around the Corner* (Ernst Lubitsch, 1940)
- *In a Lonely Place* (Nicolas Ray, 1950)
- *Daisies* (Věra Chytilová, 1966)
- *Do the Right Thing* (Spike Lee, 1989)
- *Stalker* (Andrei Tarkovsky, 1979)
- *Love and Anarchy* (Lina Wertmüller, 1973)
- *Daughters of the Dust* (Julie Dash, 1991)
- *Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind* (Hayao Miyazaki, 1984)
- *Nashville* (Robert Altman, 1975)
- *Paris is Burning* (Jennie Livingston, 1990)
- *Black Panthers* (Agnès Varda, 1968)
- *Twin Peaks* (David Lynch and Mark Frost, 1990–2017)
- *Mad Max: Fury Road* (George Miller, 2015)

You are welcome to watch these films in any manner you can, whether streaming on ELMS, off DVDs or Blu-rays from the library, or through your preferred streaming service. Many of these films are available on the [Criterion Channel](https://criterionchannel.com/). We will also screen a variety of short films and excerpts in class. 

### A Brief Note on Watching Films for a Class

I admit you are watching these films under less-than-ideal circumstances: alone, small screens, low quality, distracted attentions, poor lighting, and meager sound. Unfortunately, these are the trade-offs under which contemporary film studies—and film-going more generally—operates, ones that we will discuss at length throughout the course. Given these circumstances, here are some recommendations for maximizing your viewing experiences and critical engagement this semester: 

- Always watch with a pencil in hand. Make notes about the films as you go. What do you see? Hear? How do you understand the film's world? Throughout the course, we will develop a critical language for discussing film: apply these languages *as* you watch. 
- Re-watch the films. You might not have time to do so every week, but all films reward repeat viewings. Upon your second viewing, don't be afraid to stop, back up the film, and repeat sequences. Re-watching is integral to writing meaningfully about film. 
- Watch on the largest screen you can, in the darkest room available to you, at maximum volume. If you have friends in the course, consider taking over a common space and blacking out the windows. Find a projector and play the film on a hanging bedsheet. Cinephilia rewards creativity. 
- Watch from beginning to end without stopping and without looking at your phone. I know. This one is the hardest—for me too. But these films were made for continuous, undistracted viewing and we should approach them as such. 

## Assignments

Here's the breakdown for the class:

- Participation (25%)
- Miniature essay (0%) (no, that's not a typo!) [due 20 Feb]
- Short essay #1 / shot chart assignment (15%) [due 5 March (grace period extended to 10 March)]
- Midterm essay (20%) [due 26 March]
- Short essay #2 / editing project (15%) [due 30 April]
- Final essays (25%) [due 18 May]

What follows are short descriptions of the assignments. I'll provide longer descriptions and prompts as we get closer to the deadlines, and will update these descriptions accordingly. 

### On Deadlines

**Assignments are due at 11:59 PM on the listed days.** As a rule, I don't reduce grades for late assignments. But this comes with two caveats: I won't accept any assignments turned in more than three days late (including weekends); and late assignments will not receive much, if any feedback. If you have an extenuating circumstance that will make it difficult to make a deadline, please write me, ideally well in advance, to discuss extensions and alternatives. You'll find that I'm fairly generous in this regard. 

**You should email me assignments in a .docx file format.** Since Instructure (the company behind ELMS/Canvas) was [purchased by a private equity company](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/instructure-enters-into-a-definitive-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-thoma-bravo-300969124.html) last year, and since it makes its money by extracting data from student and instructor labor, I try to avoid using it at much as possible. I will not accept: Apple Pages files, PDFs, or links to Google Docs. I'm stringent about file formats because I use track changes to give you comments, and Microsoft Word doesn't play nice with all other formats and programs. Please give your file a descriptive name, e.g., "LastName_shot-chart.docx".

Finally, please use MLA formatting for all assignments. The [Purdue OWL](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_formatting_and_style_guide.html) is a great resource if you need to brush up on this citation format.

### Participation

In a discussion-based course, participation is crucial. Much of our intellectual work happens inside the classroom as we wrestle together with the material's questions and provocations. I assess participation holistically, taking into account your attendance, thoughtfulness of response in a variety of media, preparation for and contributions to class discussions, and how you engage the material, me, and your peers outside the classroom. This means that if you're the kind of person who doesn't always have your hand raised, you can still do quite well by participating in a variety of ways. I'll also administer the very occasional quiz in order to assess how you're picking up the course's language and engaging with the viewings/readings. Finally, I'll give you a mid-term participation assessment during spring break so you have a sense of where you stand in the course. 

Regarding attendance: more than two unexcused absences will begin to adversely affect your participation grade. Emphasis on *unexcused*: if you're ill or have a death in the family, I certainly think you should miss class! Just please keep me apprised—better to tell me what you need so we can work something out rather than drop off the map. In general, if you're absent, I encourage you to contact one of your peers for what you missed. 

### Miniature essay

A few weeks into the semester, I'll ask you to complete a very small (c. 300 words) essay. This is ungraded. I'll give you a prompt the week it's due. Its purpose is to help us gauge together your performance in the class and how you're picking up the course's vocabulary.

### Short essay #1 / shot chart

For this assignment, I'll ask you to complete a *shot chart*: a table that works moment by moment through a scene and characterizes each individual shot. You'll choose from a bank of scenes that I provide on ELMS. You'll then use this shot chart to write a short essay (c. 900 words) about the scene in which you'll connect questions of editing and cinematographic technique to the production of effect and meaning.

### Midterm essay

For our midterm, I'll ask you to write a longer essay (c. 1500 words) in which you'll put two films from the course in conversation with each other. Your goal is to develop an argument about a particular function of film language through a comparative reading of these films. We'll discuss techniques for writing about film at length during the classes preceding the midterm. 

### Short essay #2 / editing project

For this assignment, you'll experiment with techniques of film editing in order to learn more about how a scene operates. An apocryphal quote, often attributed to director Jean-Luc Godard, states that the best way to critique a film is to make another one. In this spirit, I'll ask you to re-edit a short scene (again, from a provided bank) in order to make an argument about the scene. You'll pair the scene with a short (c. 500 words) artist's statement. 

### Final essays

Our "final exam," such as it is, takes the form of three short essays of c. 750 words apiece. I'll release a bank of questions a week or two before the end of the term. You'll then select three and respond to them. 

## Schedule

<small>Please view the films and complete the class readings before our Tuesday meetings. If you're looking to prioritze the readings, we'll roughly go in chronological order, with the most important readings listed first. I imagine we'll often spend Tuesday discussing the film primarily, and then bring in the readings more deliberately on Thursday.</small>
