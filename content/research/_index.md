## Research Interests

My research bridges media studies, digital humanities, and the environmental humanities to study how media technologies facilitate our understanding of the natural world. Broadly, my work proposes new theoretical approaches to media studies that understand the environment as both the materials from which media are made as well as cultural knowledge formations that media themselves shape—the interplay of which condition the possibilities for sustainable human life on our planet. Alongside my dissertation, <a href="/tags/dissertation/">“Atmospheric Media: Computation and the Environmental Imagination,”</a> I maintain research interests in: weather forecasting, speculative fiction, nuclear cultures, digital humanities, cybersecurity, media archaeology, and software emulation.
