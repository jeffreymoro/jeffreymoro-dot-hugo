# Hi, I'm Jeffrey Moro.

<img src="/img/selfie-fall.jpg" class="selfie"/>

I'm a PhD candidate in English with a certificate in Digital Studies at the [University of Maryland](http://english.umd.edu). Right now, I'm also the [Winnemore Digital Humanities Dissertation Fellow](https://mith.umd.edu/introducing-jeffrey-moro-2020-winnemore-fellow/) at the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](https://mith.umd.edu/). 

My [research](/research) bridges media studies, digital humanities, and the environmental humanities to study how media technologies facilitate our understanding of the natural world. I'm writing a dissertation titled "Atmospheric Media: Computation and the Environmental Imagination," which explores how artists, technologists, and critics imagine digital media in terms of atmospheres, both literal and otherwiseâ€”and how these media encourage us to imagine the air itself *as* a computer, one that we might program even as it programs us.[^1] My writing has appeared or will soon appear in [*Amodern*](https://amodern.net/author/jmoro/), *Media Fields*, *Qui Parle*, and the [*Los Angeles Review of Books*](https://lareviewofbooks.org/contributor/jeffrey-moro).  

[^1]: Or, as I like to say at parties: "it's about how we use computers to imagine the air as a computer." 

[I teach](/teaching) courses in digital media studies, film studies, and writing composition. I'm also available for consultations on a range of digital humanities projects. Before graduate school, I worked as a post-baccalaureate resident with [Five College Digital Humanities](http://5colldh.org) and received degrees in English and Theater & Dance from [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu).

On this corner of the internet, you can [see some of my work](/research), [check out my CV](/cv), take a closer look at the [courses I teach](/teaching), or [read some blog posts](/blog). Though if you'd rather look at a [picture of my cat](/img/agatha-frontpage.jpg), I really couldn't blame you.
