# Hi, I'm Jeffrey Moro.

I'm a researcher, writer, and occasional computer programmer interested in how media technologies facilitate our cultural understanding of the natural world. I'm completing a PhD in English with a certificate in Digital Studies at the [University of Maryland](http://english.umd.edu). I also work as a research assistant with the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](https://mith.umd.edu/), where I've previously served as their [Winnemore Digital Humanities Dissertation Fellow](https://mith.umd.edu/introducing-jeffrey-moro-2020-winnemore-fellow/). 

[My dissertation](https://jeffreymoro.com/blog/2020-02-24-what-its-about/#abstract) is a book project titled "Atmospheric Media: Computation and the Environmental Imagination." It's a cultural study of atmospheric data across a variety of registers, from HVAC systems in data centers to Twitter bots about space probes to the toxic fumes of 3D printing. My writing has appeared in [*Amodern*](https://amodern.net/author/jmoro/), [*Media Fields*](http://mediafieldsjournal.org/air-conditioning-the-internet/), [*Qui Parle*](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/797223), and the [*Los Angeles Review of Books*](https://lareviewofbooks.org/contributor/jeffrey-moro). 

I'm always interested in new collaborations and opportunities, particularly on projects that bring together data, culture, and environmental sustainability. I am a cofounder and active team member of the [Immersive Reality Lab for the Humanities](https://irlhumanities.org/), a multidisciplinary research lab that integrates emerging digital technologies with the critical lens of the humanities. Before graduate school, I worked as a post-baccalaureate resident with [Five College Digital Humanities](http://5colldh.org) and received degrees in English and Theater & Dance from [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu).
