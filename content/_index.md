# Hi, I'm Jeffrey Moro.

I'm a researcher, writer, and tinkerer interested in how we use media technologies to make culture out of the natural world. I'm currently an Assistant Clinical Professor of Digital Humanities and Digital Studies with [African American Digital and Experimental Humanities (AADHum)](https://aadhum.umd.edu) at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I also received a PhD in English with a certificate in Digital Studies. 

I'm at work on a book titled *Cloud Studies: Techniques of Atmospheric Media*, which explores how scientists and artists alike use media to capture, interpret, and compute the air across a variety of technical and creative registers, and such media's subsequent relationships to how we understand and address climate change. You can find a list of my publications and public talks over on the [research](/research) tab. 

I welcome new collaborations and opportunities, particularly on projects that bring together data, culture, and environmental sustainability. I'm a cofounder of the [Immersive Realities Labs for the Humanities](https://irlhumanities.org/), a multidisciplinary research lab that integrates emerging digital technologies with the critical lens of the humanities. Past lives include work as a site manager for [*Romantic Circles*](http://romantic-circles.org/), a born-digital journal of Romantic literary studies, and as a post-baccalaureate resident with [Five College Digital Humanities](http://5colldh.org). 

You can learn more about my work from my [CV](/cv); I also have an idiosyncratically updated [professional blog](/blog) and a separate, even more idiosyncratic blog titled [analog.rodeo](https://analog.rodeo). And if you'd rather look at a [picture of my cat](/img/agatha-frontpage.jpg), I really couldn't blame you.
