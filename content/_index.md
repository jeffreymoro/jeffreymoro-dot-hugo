# Hi, I'm Jeffrey Moro.

<img src="/img/selfie-website.jpg" class="selfie"/>

I'm a researcher, writer, and occasional computer programmer interested in how media technologies facilitate our cultural understanding of the natural world. I hold the position of Assistant Clinical Professor of Digital Humanities and Digital Studies with the [African American Digital and Experimental Humanities (AADHum) Initiative](https://aadhum.umd.edu) at the University of Maryland, where I also received a PhD in English with a certificate in Digital Studies. 

I'm at work on a book project called *Cloud Studies*, derived from [my recently completed doctoral dissertation](https://jeffreymoro.com/blog/2022-04-01-defense-talk/). *Cloud Studies* explores how media capture, interpret, and compute the air across a variety of technical and creative registers, from HVAC systems in data centers to electronic weather diaries to the toxic fumes of 3D printing, and such media's consequent relationship to climate change. My research has appeared in the journals *Amodern*, *Media Fields*, and *Digital Humanities Quarterly*, and I've contributed reviews to *ISLE*, the *Journal of Environmental Media*, and the *Los Angeles Review of Books*. 

I welcome new collaborations and opportunities, particularly on projects that bring together data, culture, and environmental sustainability. I'm a cofounder of the [Immersive Realities Labs for the Humanities](https://irlhumanities.org/), a multidisciplinary research lab that integrates emerging digital technologies with the critical lens of the humanities. Past lives include work as a site manager for [*Romantic Circles*](http://romantic-circles.org/), a born-digital journal of Romantic literary studies, and as a post-baccalaureate resident with [Five College Digital Humanities](http://5colldh.org). 

You can find links to my work on my [CV](/cv); I also have a [blog](/blog) that I must confess I don't update much. And if you'd rather look at a [picture of my cat](/img/agatha-frontpage.jpg), I really couldn't blame you.
