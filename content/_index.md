# Hi, I'm Jeffrey Moro.

<img src="/img/selfie-website.jpg" class="selfie"/>

I'm a researcher, writer, and occasional computer programmer interested in how media technologies facilitate our cultural understanding of the natural world. I work as a Clinical Assistant Professor with the [African American Digital and Experimental Humanities (AADHum) Initiative](https://aadhum.umd.edu) at the University of Maryland, where I also received a PhD in English with a certificate in Digital Studies. 

[My recently completed doctoral dissertation](https://jeffreymoro.com/blog/2022-04-01-defense-talk/) is a book project titled "Atmospheric Media: Computation and the Environmental Imagination." It's a cultural study of how we mediate the air as data, touching a variety of registers from HVAC systems in data centers to Twitter bots about space probes to the toxic fumes of 3D printing. My writing has appeared in [*Amodern*](https://amodern.net/author/jmoro/), [*Media Fields*](http://mediafieldsjournal.org/air-conditioning-the-internet/), [*Qui Parle*](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/797223), and the [*Los Angeles Review of Books*](https://lareviewofbooks.org/contributor/jeffrey-moro). 

I'm always interested in new collaborations and opportunities, particularly on projects that bring together data, culture, and environmental sustainability. I am a cofounder and active team member of the [Immersive Realities Labs for the Humanities](https://irlhumanities.org/), a multidisciplinary research lab that integrates emerging digital technologies with the critical lens of the humanities. Past lives include work as a site manager for [Romantic Circles](http://romantic-circles.org/), a born-digital journal of Romantic literary studies, and as a post-baccalaureate resident with [Five College Digital Humanities](http://5colldh.org). 

On this corner of the internet, you can [see some of my work](/research), [check out my CV](/cv), take a closer look at the [courses I teach](/teaching), or [read some blog posts](/blog). Though if you'd rather look at a [picture of my cat](/img/agatha-frontpage.jpg), I really couldn't blame you.
