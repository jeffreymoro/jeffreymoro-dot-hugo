# Hi, I'm Jeffrey Moro.

I'm a researcher, writer, and erstwhile computer programmer interested in how media technologies facilitate our cultural understanding of the natural world. I'm completing a PhD in English with a certificate in Digital Studies at the [University of Maryland](http://english.umd.edu). I also work as a research assistant with the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](https://mith.umd.edu/), where I've previously served as their [Winnemore Digital Humanities Dissertation Fellow](https://mith.umd.edu/introducing-jeffrey-moro-2020-winnemore-fellow/). 

[My dissertation](https://jeffreymoro.com/blog/2020-02-24-what-its-about/#abstract) is a book project titled "Atmospheric Media: Computation and the Environmental Imagination," which explores how artists, technologists, and critics imagine digital media in terms of atmospheres, both literal and otherwise—and how these media encourage us to imagine the air itself *as* a computer, one that we might program even as it programs us.[^1] My writing has appeared in [*Amodern*](https://amodern.net/author/jmoro/), [*Media Fields*](http://mediafieldsjournal.org/air-conditioning-the-internet/), [*Qui Parle*](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/797223), and the [*Los Angeles Review of Books*](https://lareviewofbooks.org/contributor/jeffrey-moro). 

[^1]: Or, as I like to say at parties: "it's about how we imagine computers as the air—and the air as a computer."

I'm always interested in new collaborations and opportunities, particularly on projects that bring together data, culture, and environmental sustainability. I am a cofounder and active team member of the [Immersive Reality Lab for the Humanities](https://irlhumanities.org/), a multidisciplinary research lab that integrates emerging digital technologies with the critical lens of the humanities. Before graduate school, I worked as a post-baccalaureate resident with [Five College Digital Humanities](http://5colldh.org) and received degrees in English and Theater & Dance from [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu).
